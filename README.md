# mgt
MG decomposed and reformulated with interfaces, described in 
[Stabler 2024 "Modular minimalist grammars" - slides](https://github.com/epstabler/mgt/slidesAnnotatedApps3.pdf)

A longer paper describing the project is forthcoming.

** preliminary implementations, in progress **

## haskell/

An implementation of merge, *-merge, with labeling, head movement, and linearization.
This typed, higher order language is good for carefully assessing the anatomy of these processes.
This code provides the clearest formulation of this grammar formalism.

## python/ 

Ported from the Haskell, a Python 3.x implementation of merge, *-merge, labeling, interfaces.
