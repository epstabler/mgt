# mgt
MG decomposed and reformulated with interfaces.

Preliminary description in slides. A paper describing the project is forthcoming.

** preliminary implementations, in progress **

## haskell/

An implementation of merge, *-merge, with labeling, head movement, linearization, and m-merger.

Haskell is a typed higher order language, good for carefully assessing the anatomy of these processes.
This code provides the clearest formulation of this grammar formalism.

## python/ 

Ported from the Haskell, a Python 3.x implementation of merge, *-merge, labeling, interfaces.
