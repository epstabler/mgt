# Python implementations of MG structure-defining functions

I used [python 3.11](https://www.python.org/).
No exotic language features are used, so this should work for some time.
For structure display, I use nltk which can be installed with:

```
> pip install nltk
```

This code was designed to mimic the prior Haskell implementation, so it
has a functional style.

To run a simple example of binary merge, type:

```
> python MgcBinTests
```

To use Mgc with its unbounded branching,

```
> python MgcTests
```

See the code and comments for many other examples.
