# Python implementations of MG structure-defining functions

I used [python 3.11](https://www.python.org/).
No exotic language features are used, so this should work for some time.

For the implementation of multisets, frozendict.

And for graphical structure display, I use nltk -- but that is optional.

```
> pip3 install nltk
> pip3 install frozendict
```

To run some simple examples, type:

```
> python3
>>> from mgTests import *
>>> ex24a()
>>> ex0019()
>>> ex0019a()
>>> ex24a()
>>> ex0204a()
>>> ex1204a()
```

See the code and comments for many other examples.
