# Python implementations of MG structure-defining functions

NB: THIS CODE HAS NOT YET CAUGHT UP WITH THE HASKELL

I used [python 3.11](https://www.python.org/).
No exotic language features are used, so this should work for some time.
For structure display, I use nltk which can be installed with:

```
> pip install nltk
```

To run some simple examples, type:

```
> python
>>> from mgTests import *
>>> ex24a()
>>> ex0019()
>>> ex0019a()
>>> ex24a()
>>> ex0204a()
>>> ex1204a()
```

See the code and comments for many other examples.
